# Tic-tac-toe game

This is an exercise to practice OOP in Ruby.

## Built With

- Ruby

## Getting Started - Rules

The tic-tac-toe game is a two person game in which the players take turns choosing available positions in a 3칑3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of his marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
For example:


| X 	|  	|  	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| O 	| X 	|
| O 	|  	| X 	|

In this example, the player who marked the empty spaces with an X won the game.

## How to run the game

### Prerequisites

The game is written in Ruby, so in order to play it you should:
1. have Ruby (v2.7.0 or newer) installed in your machine.
1. download and uncompress the code
1. go to the folder where you uncompressed the code and run this command: bin/main.rb (you must make sure that you have both /lib and /bin folders after uncompression)

### With the game running:

* the first player introduces the desired nick-name (only non-empty nick-names are allwed) and immediatly is asked to choose a mark: X or O
* the second player is asked to introduce a nick-name and will use the mark not chosen by the first player
* every space in the board is a "position", and they are numbered this way:

| 1 	| 2 	| 3 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| 4 	| 5 	| 6 	|
| 7 	| 8 	| 9 	|

* taking this order into account, players will take turns to choose an available position in the board
* the game can finish with a winner or in a draw
